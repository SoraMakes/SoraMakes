## About Me

**Previous GitHub name: Glutamat42**

I'm a developer and DevOps engineer with an M.Sc. in Computer Science. My experience spans software development, infrastructure automation, project management, and public engagement—such as running workshops and representing our products at events.

#### Key Technical Projects & Interests

- **Machine Learning & Autonomous Systems:**  
  My master's thesis focused on uncertainty prediction methods for steering angle prediction tasks.

- **DevOps & Infrastructure (ProjektAdler):**  
  I maintain several repositories under the ProjektAdler umbrella, most notably:
  - **[AdLerStack](https://github.com/ProjektAdLer/AdLerStack)** – A comprehensive deployment stack with robust end-to-end tests using Playwright, serving as the base for our deployments.
  - **[MoodleAdlerLMS](https://github.com/ProjektAdLer/MoodleAdlerLMS)** – A highly customized Moodle instance with tailored plugins and configurations for our needs, including all of my plugins.

- **Moodle Plugins Development:**  
  As part of our 3D game-based learning environment project for students, I develop and maintain a suite of Moodle plugins that enable seamless integration between a serious game and the LMS.  
  This approach allows students to freely switch between the 3D game and Moodle at any time, choosing their preferred learning experience without limitations.  
  The plugins extend Moodle with necessary features (APIs, endpoints, enhancements) to support this integration.

  - **[local_declarativesetup](https://github.com/ProjektAdLer/MoodlePlugin-local_declarativesetup):** Enables declarative configuration of Moodle systems—similar to Ansible for infrastructure.  
  - **Other plugins:**  
    - [local_adler](https://github.com/ProjektAdLer/MoodlePlugin-local_adler)  
    - [local_logging](https://github.com/ProjektAdLer/MoodlePlugin-local_logging)  
    - [availability_adler](https://github.com/ProjektAdLer/MoodlePlugin-availability_adler)  
    - [mod_adleradaptivity](https://github.com/ProjektAdLer/MoodlePlugin-mod_adleradaptivity)  
    - [playbook_adler](https://github.com/ProjektAdLer/MoodlePlugin-playbook_adler)  
    Each of these provides targeted enhancements, integrations, or APIs needed for the 3D learning game and LMS to work together smoothly.

- **3D Printing & CAD Design:**  
  I am learning to design my own models in Fusion 360 and Onshape, I enjoy designing and printing practical and experimental parts. You can view my projects here: [Printables Profile](https://www.printables.com/@Markus_2936887).

- **Linux, Android & Mobile Productivity:**  
  I’m currently working on [termux-desktop](https://github.com/Glutamat42/termux-desktops), a project to create a functional Debian chroot desktop environment on Android—enabling full-featured development workflows on my tablet.

- **Other Interests:**  
  I have a strong curiosity about data compression techniques and enjoy experimenting with related tools and algorithms.
